Alphabet Board
=============

An *Alphabet Board* is a simple tool that enables communication with someone who is unable to speak or write their message.

It is a grid of letters and/or other symbols on a flat surface, often a piece of paper or card. Letter by letter, the person receiving the message asks whether each letter is in the message. The person communicating indicates positive or negative by whatever means they are able: by blinking, nodding or making a sound for example.
